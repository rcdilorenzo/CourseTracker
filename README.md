# CourseTracker
App for managing runners in a particular obstacle course with teams

This app will at least be initially used during the annual Memorial Day Celebration at the Brown Farm in Wake Forest, NC. It is particularly generic, but some features are currently a bit specific to the event.

With this app, runners are assigned a team on the first run in the obstacle course. Once assigned, they will run with a number of other people in their team through the course, receiving a single time for the contestants in that run. At the end of the day, prizes will be given based on several statistics, including fastest team and fastest run of the day.

Here is a preliminary screenshot of the runner screen as a sample:

# Usage

You'll need to have both `carthage` and `pod` installed. See the documentation for installing dependencies for [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods).

Then open `CourseTracker.xcworkspace` and run it!
